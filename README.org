* Oh no, had to mouse! ðŸ˜–

Hi! This is an issues repo from me, a person trying to go all-in on keyboards and leave that non-discrete, mouseful life behind me.

I'm currently on MacOS, using Chrome with Vimium, and Spacemacs.

Every time something makes me mouse, I'll come here and post an issue about it or increment an existing one.

When I find a fix, I'll post the solution and close the issue.

You're welcome to post your own `ohnohadtomouse` issues, and of course I'd love it if you could pitch in with solutions to existing ones.

Let's keyboard! ðŸ¤˜ðŸŽ¹ðŸ˜ˆ
